# Spellcheck dictionaries

The aim of this project is to collect any open-source American English (GA) pronunciation dictionaries and lexicons and to produce a phonemic spellcheck for English language.
The purpose of creating a _phonemic_ (not _phonetic_) spellcheck is to create a tool for English learners, so they would be able to train their _phonemic awareness_.

>Spellcheck provides an _**immediate**_ feedback!
